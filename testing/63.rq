# CQ-63: What is the firmware version of the device?
# Based on the Core Module, a device is modelled as an aml:HardwareAgent. The standard AnIML property for versioning hardware is aml:firmwareVersion (consistent with aml:version on SoftwareAgents).

PREFIX aml: <http://www.w3.org/animl/ontology/>

SELECT ?firmwareVersion
WHERE {
    ?device a aml:HardwareAgent ;
            aml:firmwareVersion ?firmwareVersion .
