# CQ-91: What is the URI for a cited literature reference in a technique definition?
# The Technique Module includes aml:citation on the aml:Technique class. While the diagram shows it as a string, in a Linked Data context, this property (or rdfs:seeAlso) often contains the URI/DOI of the reference.

PREFIX aml: <http://www.w3.org/animl/ontology/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?referenceURI
WHERE {
    ?technique a aml:Technique ;
               aml:citation ?referenceURI . 
    # Alternatively check rdfs:seeAlso
